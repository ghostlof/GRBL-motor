# Current Limit (Reference Voltage) Adjustment for Stepper Driver
A4988 sold by Zyltech, Rs=0.1 ohm. Thus the max current is Vref/0.4

Vref (Reference Voltage) is measured using a voltmeter between the ground of power supply and VDD of A4988 shield :

![measure 2](https://github.com/ghostlof/GRBL-motor/blob/master/Images/Vref.PNG)  

Vref = Imax /2 ;  
Imax is the maximal current __for one phase only__. 
Reference voltage is adjusted with a small screwdriver at the point indicated with the white arrow in the picture to the right. We suggest adjusting the reference voltage in small increments - no more than a quarter turn at a time.
